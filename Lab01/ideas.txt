Idea 0: I'm a leader for Calvin Video Game Sphere, a club that meets every Friday and hosts many video games for people to enjoy. One limitation of our club is that we only have a limited number of TVs to use, so we can't always have every game that everyone wants every week. An app that could be useful for us as leaders and for the club members is a sort of app that users can submit suggestions for what games to have on certain days. Then we as leaders can decide the games, and let people know through the app. Perhaps it could send notifications to users if they sign up to be notified about certain games being available.

Idea 1: I'd like to build an app that can remotely control a satelite. The satelite is used to deliver fast food. The food would have to be sent up to the satelite, but then it can be ejected anywhere on the planet, arriving right at your doorstep no matter where you live. Ideally, we'd want to build a space station where we can prepare the food on-site so it can be more fresh, but we probably don't have the budget for that.
