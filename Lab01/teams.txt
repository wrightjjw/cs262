Technical
	I've worked with Java, but not on any of the other listed topics.
	For Java, I've worked on my own Swing desktop app.

	I have minimal experience with Slack, using it for communication on a project I never actually did any work on.
	I've used Git with Github and Gitlab to keep track of my own projects, and for a larger team project a few years ago.

	I have an LG G7 running Android 8.0.0

	I don't really care what project to work on. I've done a few projects of my own, and I'm interested in trying to work on someone else's idea for once, since that's likely what I'll end up doing professionally. If I had to pick a project of my own, I'd be interested in making the tactable app from my suggestion in this lab.

	I'd definitely be interested in working with Collin and/or Ian Lilienthal, Catherine DeJaeger, Annika Johnson, and Nate Walter.
